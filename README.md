Problem Statement : Journaling is an ancient tradition that has increasing evidence to support the positive impact on our mental health, social and psychological wellbeing.
In today's fast-paced world, individuals often struggle to dedicate adequate time and effort to meaningful self-reflection through journaling. 
This results in a collection of unorganized, emotionally charged entries that lack actionable insights. 

Solution: The objective is to develop a tool that transforms these chaotic journal entries into a structured emotional weather report and extracts key thematic insights, providing users with a concise and actionable overview of their mental and emotional landscape, effectively streamlining the process of self-discovery.
